# IAmDocumentation
A repo for technical documentation that I've written. Content-wise it'll mostly focus on IT- and development-related stuff: server configuration, getting a CRUD app up and running, stuff like that.

The ultimate goal of all of this is to help me remember how to set up things I might not work with on a day-to-day basis. I've become a jack-of-all-trades and have lots of little bits of experience here and there, but I jump around often enough that I rely on documentation like this to help me keep things running. If these works assist others along the way, then I'm glad I was able to help.

And I freely admit that I might make a mistake here or there. I will gladly accept pull requests for anything egregiously wrong.

### A Forewarning
Everything's written in Markdown because I wanted an excuse to start using it. Everything should look fine on GitHub, but I'm using Markdown Preview in Sublime Text to preview output so some stuff may not be supported here. I haven't yet decided if I'm going to scrub that stuff from my work as I discover it...
