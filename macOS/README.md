# macOS Documentation

Notes for getting the most out of macOS

## Files

### setup_macos.sh

A bash script to automate as much of my initial setup and configuration of macOS as I can. A list of additional steps that couldn't be automated (yet) are saved to the Desktop.

TODO: Figure out how much of the manual configuration can in fact be automated! I found out about **osascript** for setting the menubar to dark mode - perhaps it can be used for un/checking some of the other boxes in System Preferences?

### TipsAndTricks.md

This was the original document I prepared to help me keep track of how I configured a fresh instance of macOS. Most of what's contained wihtin is now taken care of by setup_macos.sh, but there're some more in-depth explanations and links to third-party software so I've kept it around.
